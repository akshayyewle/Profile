I have about 10 years of professional experience in the field of New Product Design & Technology Development. I have also handled Project Management aspect of these projects for the last 4-5 years while being a spectator for the product management strategies played out by our marketing team. I see all 3 domains - Engineering Design, Project Management & Product Management as a part of a necessary mix for product launches that are successful on both the technically & commercially fronts.

I have always been passionate about creating new things that are a better version of their current form. I believe that’s the next evolutionary phase once you figure out how something works. Legendary creators see their products as an extension of their identity & that’s the spirit that gave these products a cult iconic status market. Apart from the Mechanical Product Design & Project Management, I have a keen interest in Business Analytics & Product Management, that together drive the decision on selecting the right product at the right time for the right customer in the given market. In short, I have a fascination for the way ideas are created on whiteboards & then make their way into the market. I have been fortunate to have witnessed some of these journeys myself.

I believe in the core values of innovation & interaction; and strive to fulfil ambitious commitments with a sense of ownership & urgency. Driven by a passion for working with leading technologies & creating sustainable business values. I have an explorer mindset that doesn't shy away from working with High Risk - High Reward objectives that aspire to bring a paradigm shift to the conventional way of making things happen.
